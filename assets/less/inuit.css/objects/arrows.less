/**
 * It is a common design treatment to give an element a triangular points-out
 * arrow, we typically build these with CSS. These following classes allow us to
 * generate these arbitrarily with a mixin, `@arrow()`.
 */



/**
 * Note re LESS.
 *
 * In the sass original this file contains some silent classes to be extended 
 * upon using the arrow mixin. LESS does not yet include this functionality
 * so this file is empty and the mixin does all the work
