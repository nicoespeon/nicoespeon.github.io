As you might imagine, I’m both thrilled and scared. Thus, I’m preparing these talks – last thing I want would be to screw up in front of hundred of people I don’t know 😅</p>\n<p>I already have <a href=\"https://dev.to/aspittel/public-speaking-as-a-developer-2ihj\">plenty</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@zenorocha/what-ive-learned-after-giving-100-talks-8f175654e945\">good</a> <a href=\"http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2014-04-04-crafting-a-conference-talk.html\">resources</a> about giving such talks and <a href=\"https://www.deconstructconf.com/blog/how-to-prepare-a-talk\">preparing great slides</a>. Actually, I used to provide such advices and coach speakers-wannabe to talk at meetups, back in Paris.</p>\n<p>But today, I came across a short video titled “How to Start a Speech”. The fact it’s a 9min video is great: it goes to the point. I watched it after lunch time, and it was both catchy and insightful.</p>\n<p>So, there are 2 common mistakes speakers do when they start their talk:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A very formal talk introduction: <em>“My name is Nicolas Carlo, I work at Busbud, today I’m gonna talk about ‘The secrets of Hexagonal Architecture’”</em>. All of this, people already know – they do have a program. As I’m spending time repeating this information, it gives the audience time to disconnect from me and look at their phone while I’m going through usual stuff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A very hesitating introduction: <em>“Aaaaaah eeeeeeeeeh… Is the mic working?… Yes… Ok… Right… hmmmm…”</em>. Which is obviously not very engaging. It could happen though, because stress. My personal advice here, is to practice the talk before – in front of colleagues at work, or/and in a local meetup. Practicing out loud at home and recording the video is also really helpful to self-improve our talk delivery.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The second one is obvious, but I didn’t thought too much about the first one. It’s obviously the classical way of doing it, and most of speakers I know do it like that – including myself.</p>\n<p>Then, here are 3 better ways to start a talk:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>🤔 <strong>Ask a question that matters to the audience.</strong> The idea is to make people relate to the problem. If I raise a question that you also have at work, it’s likely you’ll be interested in knowing the answer. The talk is here to answer that question.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🙀 <strong>Start with a fact that shocks.</strong> It’s really easy today to access facts, studies and different resources. A fact can illustrate the whole point of the talk, or be somehow related. Having a powerful fact that will force the audience into rethinking what they know is really catchy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📖 <strong>Tell a story.</strong> Actually, it’s not something new. Still, it holds true. Even more for conferences talks. “Once upon a time” makes children lean forward. And the grown up way of saying “Once upon a time” is to tell a story, usually one from your own life. A story that connects you to the subject of the talk. A story that explains why it is important to you. For example, “the first time” you discover the benefits of the thing you’re presenting.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s it. I’ll personnally try to rework the introduction of my Confoo talk to start with a story – which is not that hard, I do have a story and fun facts to tell about it!</p>\n<p>Here’s the full video if you have some more time to watch it. In my opinion, it worth it:</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w82a1FT5o88\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p><strong>And you, do you have tips &#x26; tricks for public speaking?</strong></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/til/","/tags/public-speaking/"],"slug":"/en/2019/01/til-how-to-start-a-talk/"},"timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"TIL: How to start a talk","tags":["til","public speaking"],"date":"2019-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Today, I learned how to do a great introduction for a conference talk."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/en/2019/01/til-how-to-start-a-talk/"}}
