Today, I work at <a href=\"https://www.busbud.com/\">Busbud</a>. We sell intercity bus tickets, worldwide. We talk about things like Seat, Departure, Leg, Stop, Roundtrip… These are specific to our business, and we understand this vocabulary in a given context. We also have Taxes, Fees, Discount Code that you probably have to. This is a more generic Domain for us, but it’s still business.</p>\n<p>The Infrastructure part is how is our current solution made. Fastly, Postgres databases, Redis instances, Express server, React… All of these technologies we use to provide busbud.com to travellers across the planet. But we could change the infrastructure, still we do the same business.</p>\n<p>The Hexagonal Architecture is the simplest way to do this separation. Put your Domain at the heart of your software. Make your Infra depends on your Domain, and your Domain not depending on your Infra. Use business vocabulary inside the Domain part, to define intention-revealing interfaces (aka Ports). Build concrete implementations of these interfaces in your Infra (aka Adapters). That gives you the flexibility to plug any adapter to your domain.</p>\n<p>It makes testing easy. It allows you to start with something simple, and evolve the infrastructure when actually needed. Finally, It’s a good first step towards Clean Architecture.</p>\n<p>Here are the slides of the talk:</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 81.5126050420168%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/Mj96vePpslBlHM\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"> <strong> <a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/nicolascarlo1/the-secrets-of-hexagonal-architecture\" title=\"The Secrets of Hexagonal Architecture\" target=\"_blank\">The Secrets of Hexagonal Architecture</a> </strong> de <strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/nicolascarlo1\" target=\"_blank\">Nicolas Carlo</a></strong> </div>\n          </div>\n          </div>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/hexagonal-architecture/","/tags/ports-and-adapters-architecture/","/tags/talk/","/tags/software-craftsmanship/"],"slug":"/en/2019/03/the-secrets-of-hexagonal-architecture/"},"timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"The Secrets of Hexagonal Architecture","tags":["hexagonal architecture","ports and adapters architecture","talk","software craftsmanship"],"date":"2019-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","description":"A talk I gave at ConFoo Montréal 2019 about Hexagonal Architecture."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/en/2019/03/the-secrets-of-hexagonal-architecture/"}}
