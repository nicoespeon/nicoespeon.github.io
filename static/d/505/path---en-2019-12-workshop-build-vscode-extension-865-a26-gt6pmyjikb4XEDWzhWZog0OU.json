A reason for such fame is Extensions. You can pick and install just the ones that fit your needs. You can customize VS Code to be super-productive. Thatâ€™s cool.</p>\n<p>But have you ever considered going further, and <strong>build your own VS Code Extension?</strong></p>\n<p>In this hands-on, we show you how to create, configure, package and publish a VS Code Extension. You will understand how you can manipulate the structure of your code, using the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). With this, youâ€™ll build your first VS Code Extension that will perform your own, custom, automated refactorings.</p>\n<p>You can follow the workshop using this repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/nicoespeon/talk-build-your-first-vscode-extension\">nicoespeon/talk-build-your-first-vscode-extension</a>.</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/udNV7zPN1H8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p>Following up this workshop, Iâ€™d advise you to try <a href=\"https://vscode-abracadabra.com\">Abracadabra</a>.
