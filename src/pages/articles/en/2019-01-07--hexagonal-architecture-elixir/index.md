This is a talk I gave at the [Montr√©al Elixir](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/montrealelixir/events/256148599/) meetup of November 2018.

Let's start from scratch and go beyond the buzzwords.

We'll go together through these ideas to understand how you can improve the maintainability of your projects, either greenfield or legacy.

We'll see how it can be achieved in Elixir to check if it goes along the philosophy of the language.
