Git is the kind of awesome tool that keeps giving. Ok, this feature is not as impressive as [git worktree](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/06/26/parallelize-development-git-worktrees/) or [the powerful reflog](http://effectif.com/git/recovering-lost-git-commits), but it's very handy.

Say you're on a branch. You checkout to `master` temporarily. Then, you want to come back to your branch. Waitâ€¦ what's the name of your branch again?

Turns out, you can just ask git to go back to the previous branch you were on with `git checkout -`

It works like `cd -`: it checkouts the previous branch and if you run it twice, you'll end up on the same branch you're now.

And you, do you have any git trick? ðŸ˜œ
