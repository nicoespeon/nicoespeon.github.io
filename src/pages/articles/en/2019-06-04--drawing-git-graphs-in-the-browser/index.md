description: A talk I gave at FullStack NYC 2019 to present GitGraph.js.
---

In this talk I presented a side-project that I've been developing with my friend [Fabien Bernard][fabien0102] since 2013: [GitGraph.js][gitgraph.js] ðŸŽ‰

It's a JS library that allows you to draw git graphs in the browser. Very handy to prepare presentations or write blog posts. Creating and updating those git illustrations becomes easy!

I already [wrote about GitGraph.js in the past](/en/2013/11/gitgraphjs/).

If there is one thing you should retain from my talk, itâ€™s that **you can hack your own problems**. You certainly have this crazy idea in mind, that problem you want to solve for yourselfâ€¦ Stop waiting the perfect moment, just start doing it. **Good things will happen!**

The project is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/nicoespeon/gitgraph.js/>

Different libraries are available:

* [`@gitgraph/js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gitgraph/js) for the vanilla JS version
* [`@gitgraph/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gitgraph/react) for the React version
* There is a [browser bundle](https://github.com/nicoespeon/gitgraph.js/tree/master/packages/gitgraph-js#browser-bundle-ready-to-use) you can use directly in the browser ðŸ’ª

If you want to play with the GitGraph.js, have a look at the online playground:
