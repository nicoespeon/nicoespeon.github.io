Few days ago, I went to [Montr√©al Elixir meetup of March](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/montrealelixir/events/247188552/).

I‚Äôm French. I moved to Montr√©al in February. Thus, this is the beginning of a new life for me ; a Canadian-dream as a Developer at Busbud. I used to attend / talk at / organize a lot of meetups, back in Paris. I‚Äôm now looking to meet the tech community of Montr√©al.

So here is my feedback about how this meetup was, and what you could expect from it.

By the way, if you don‚Äôt know it yet: [Elixir is a dynamic, functional language](https://elixir-lang.org/).

It is built upon Erlang shoulders, which is really fault-tolerant and built for scalability (think telecoms). To put them in a nutshell, I‚Äôd say Elixir main goals are: productivity, maintainability and reliability.

[Montr√©al Elixir](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/montrealelixir/) is a monthly meetup. The community is not big ‚àí we were around 20 persons at the event.

They do have a website: [http://www.montrealelixir.ca](http://www.montrealelixir.ca/)

The typical agenda of the meetup is:

* **Networking & food** first, which is a nice ice-breaker.
* **Announcements** from Elixir community, about books, news from the meetup organizers‚Ä¶
* **Talks**, usually 20 minutes ones. But we‚Äôll try some lightning talks (5min) in the future.
* **Sponsor talks & open mic** to anyone who‚Äôd have something to share to the group

It starts at 18:30, ends at 20:00, which is great if you want to go back home early. People generally speak english there, so it‚Äôs more inclusive.

This meetup talk was from [Pedro Medeiros](https://twitter.com/pesnk) on **‚ÄúElixir formatter internals‚Äù**.

In case you wonder, a formatter is a tool that aims to maintain a consistent style for your project. Thus, you don‚Äôt loose time discussing whether there must be a space before your parenthesis, nor you waste time with the linter telling you that you forgot a trailing space somewhere.

If you are familiar with JavaScript rather than Elixir, this is [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) goal. Handles the syntax for you so you don‚Äôt have to bother. If you do Elm, this is [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) job.

So it really helps **productivity**.

Elixir formatter is built-in. You can run it with `mix format`.

The talk focused on how the formatter works to format your code ‚àí building an AST, then logically applying the standard rules to re-write your code with proper indentation/spaces‚Ä¶

The meetup was nice and I enjoyed the community. I met and discussed with [Henry Olders](http://henry.olders.ca/wordpress/), who is both a psychiatrist and engineer. We discussed machine learning, Elixir and scalability.

üòÉüëç I really enjoyed that time and will come back to next sessions. Join us!

To conclude, here are some books recommendation I get from the meetup:

* üìï [Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/book/lhelph/functional-web-development-with-elixir-otp-and-phoenix)
* üìò [Learn Functional Programming with Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/cdc-elixir/learn-functional-programming-with-elixir) (good for beginners and newcomers to Functional Programming)
* üìÑ [To spawn or not to spawn](http://theerlangelist.com/article/spawn_or_not) to understand how to _think_ in terms of processes, from the author of [Elixir in action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition)
