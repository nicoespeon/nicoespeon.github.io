My name is **Nicolas Carlo**.

I am a web developer, currently working at [Centered](https://centered.app), from Montreal, Canada.

I help people build maintainable softwares. I'm specialized in working with Legacy Code.

In Montreal, I organize the meetup [Software Crafters](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Software-Crafters-Montreal/) each month.

I also co-organize the [SoCraTes Canada](https://socrates-ca.github.io/) conference every year and [The Legacy of SoCraTes](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/the-legacy-of-socrates) remote conference on Legacy Code.

## Before

In Paris, I organized:

- the meetup [Backbone.js Paris](https://www.meetup.com/backbone-paris/)
- the meetup [Paris WebComponents](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/paris-webComponents/)
- the annual conference [Best of Web Paris](https://bestofweb.paris/).

From 2016 to 2018, I was Consultant at [OCTO Technology](https://www.octo.com/). I supported clients running their Agile projects, I did web development and I coached about Software Craftsmanship practices.

From 2013 to 2016, I was associate as VP of Engineering of a start-up called [Metidia](http://www.metidia.com). I mainly dealt with the development of HTML5 games (Canvas, Backbone.js, Node.js, MongoDB), as well as managing the production team (4 to 6 persons). [I wrote about that](/en/2016/01/kanban-game-development-trello/).

Before that, I was a freelance web developer. I did many missions for different clients, front-end and back-end.
