My name is **Nicolas Carlo**.

I am a freelance web developer living and working from Montreal, Canada.

I help people build maintainable softwares. I'm specialized in working with Legacy Code.

I'm _really_ into community events üçª I organize the [Software Crafters](https://guild.host/software-crafters-montreal/events) and the [React](https://guild.host/react-montreal/events) Montr√©al guilds. I also give a hand to other local communities, such as the [TypeScript](https://guild.host/typescript-montreal/events) and [Elixir](https://guild.host/elixir-montreal/events) ones. In the past, I've also organized [The Legacy of SoCraTes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0M37QolwmwobAY4Bt8Tszg), [SoCraTes Canada](https://socrates-ca.github.io/), and [MenderCon](https://mendercon.com) conferences.

## Before

In Paris, I organized:

- the meetup [Backbone.js Paris](https://www.meetup.com/backbone-paris/)
- the meetup [Paris WebComponents](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/paris-webComponents/)
- the annual conference [Best of Web Paris](https://bestofweb.paris/).

From 2016 to 2018, I was Consultant at [OCTO Technology](https://www.octo.com/). I supported clients running their Agile projects, I did web development and I coached about Software Craftsmanship practices.

From 2013 to 2016, I was associate as VP of Engineering of a start-up called [Metidia](http://www.metidia.com). I mainly dealt with the development of HTML5 games (Canvas, Backbone.js, Node.js, MongoDB), as well as managing the production team (4 to 6 persons). [I wrote about that](/en/2016/01/kanban-game-development-trello/).

Before that, I was a freelance web developer. I did many missions for different clients, front-end and back-end.
